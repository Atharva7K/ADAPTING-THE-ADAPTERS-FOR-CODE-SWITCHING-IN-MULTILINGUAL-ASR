### **ABSTRACT**

Recently, large pre-trained multilingual speech models
have shown potential in scaling Automatic Speech Recogni-
tion (ASR) to many low-resource languages. Some of these
models employ language adapters in their formulation, which
helps to improve monolingual performance and avoids some
of the drawbacks of multi-lingual modeling on resource-rich
languages. However, this formulation restricts the usability
of these models on code-switched speech, where two lan-
guages are mixed together in the same utterance. In this
work, we propose ways to effectively fine-tune such mod-
els on code-switched speech, by assimilating information
from both language adapters at each language adaptation
point in the network. We also model code-switching as a
sequence of latent binary sequences that can be used to guide
the flow of information from each language adapter at the
frame level. The proposed approaches are evaluated on three
code-switched datasets encompassing Arabic, Mandarin, and
Hindi languages paired with English, showing consistent im-
provements in code-switching performance with at least 10%
absolute reduction in CER across all test sets.

### Installation
Clone this repository 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Atharva7K/MMS-Code-Switching
```
NOTE: This repo includes the entire codebase of [hugging face transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). We write our modifications on top of their codebase. Most of our modified code is in [this file](https://github.com/Atharva7K/MMS-Code-Switching/transformers/models/wav2vec2/modeling_wav2vec2.py). 

#### Install dependancies

First we recommend creating a new conda environment especially if you have transformers already installed. We will be installing modified code for the transformers library from this repo which can cause conflicts with your existing installation. Hence create and activate new environment using 
```bash
conda create -n mms-code-switching python=3.10.2
conda activate mms-code-switching 
```

#### Install modified transformers code
```bash
cd transformers/
pip install -e .
```

#### Install other dependancies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We also provide MMS checkpoints after finetuning matrix-language adapters on the 3 datasets. NOTE: In order to do inference on these finetuned checkpoints, one should use standard implementation of [MMS from huggingface](https://huggingface.co/facebook/mms-1b-all) instead of our modified transformers code. 

#### Do inference

Use `main` branch for Transformer Code Switching (TCS) and `post-adapter-switching` branch for Post Adapter Code Swtiching (TACS). Ex:-

Check `demo.ipynb` for inference demo.

#### Output transcripts

We also share transcripts generated by our proposed systems on the 3 datasets in `generated_transcripts/`.
